ROMCAL is a package of software to generate the General Roman Calendar
for any given Gregorian calendar year. The program uses the revised
liturgical calendar for the Western Church as approved by Paul VI in
Mysterii Paschalis dated 14 February 1969, and implemented in the
United States in 1972, although any year may be given to the program.

The program is written in the C Programming Language and is designed
and packaged for Unix-based operating systems.

Please note that this program was developed as a mental exercise. No
fee is charged for it, no warranty is given, and use is restricted to
non-commercial applications. The author's employer has no association
with this program.
